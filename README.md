A Cross-Platform React-Native Application for Managing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Symptoms and Lifestyle

## Running Code && Contributing

You must have Node.js and `npm` installed on your machine before you can compile and run this project. Check out [this site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download the appropriate version for your computer. 

Once you've installed node, clone the repository and enter the project directory.

Then run:

```
$ npm install
```

If you need to install any other packages on in the project, use the expo cli rather than `npm` for installation (because npm might install versions of our dependencies that are incompatible with expo. You can do this by substituting `expo` for `npm` when installing, e.g.

```
$ expo install @react-native-storage/async-storage
```
